    "The Java programming language is statically-typed, which means that all variables must first be declared before they can be used. This involves stating the variable's type and name, as you've already seen:\n",
    "\n",
    "int gear = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "byte: The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127 (inclusive). The byte data type can be useful for saving memory in large arrays, where the memory savings actually matters. They can also be used in place of int where their limits help to clarify your code; the fact that a variable's range is limited can serve as a form of documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "short: The short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767 (inclusive). As with byte, the same guidelines apply: you can use a short to save memory in large arrays, in situations where the memory savings actually matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "int: By default, the int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer, which has a minimum value of -231 and a maximum value of 231-1. In Java SE 8 and later, you can use the int data type to represent an unsigned 32-bit integer, which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 232-1. Use the Integer class to use int data type as an unsigned integer. See the section The Number Classes for more information. Static methods like compareUnsigned, divideUnsigned etc have been added to the Integer class to support the arithmetic operations for unsigned integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "long: The long data type is a 64-bit two's complement integer. The signed long has a minimum value of -263 and a maximum value of 263-1. In Java SE 8 and later, you can use the long data type to represent an unsigned 64-bit long, which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 264-1. Use this data type when you need a range of values wider than those provided by int. The Long class also contains methods like compareUnsigned, divideUnsigned etc to support arithmetic operations for unsigned long.\n",
    "\n",
    "float: The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point. Its range of values is beyond the scope of this discussion, but is specified in the Floating-Point Types, Formats, and Values section of the Java Language Specification. As with the recommendations for byte and short, use a float (instead of double) if you need to save memory in large arrays of floating point numbers. This data type should never be used for precise values, such as currency. For that, you will need to use the java.math.BigDecimal class instead. Numbers and Strings covers BigDecimal and other useful classes provided by the Java platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "double: The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point. Its range of values is beyond the scope of this discussion, but is specified in the Floating-Point Types, Formats, and Values section of the Java Language Specification. For decimal values, this data type is generally the default choice. As mentioned above, this data type should never be used for precise values, such as currency.\n",
    "\n",
    "boolean: The boolean data type has only two possible values: true and false. Use this data type for simple flags that track true/false conditions. This data type represents one bit of information, but its \"size\" isn't something that's precisely defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "char: The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. It has a minimum value of '\\u0000' (or 0) and a maximum value of '\\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive).\n",

    "The variables or data defined within a class are called instance variables. Code is always contained in the methods. Therefore, the methods and variables defined within a class are called members of the class. All the methods have the same form as the main () these methods are not specified as static or public. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is Abstraction?  \n",
    "Abstraction is a process which displays only the information needed and hides the unnecessary information. We can say that the main purpose of abstraction is data hiding. Abstraction means selecting data from a large number of data to show the information needed, which helps in reducing programming complexity and efforts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also abstract classes and abstract methods. An abstract class is a type of class that declares one or more abstract methods. An abstract method is a method that has a method definition but not implementation. Once we have modelled our object using data abstraction, the same sets of data can also be used in different applications—abstract classes, generic types of behaviours and object-oriented programming hierarchy. Abstract methods are used when two or more subclasses do the same task in different ways and through different implementations. An abstract class can have both methods, i.e., abstract methods and regular methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us see an example related to abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to create a student application and ask to collect information about the student.\n",
    "\n",
    "We collect the following information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Name \n",
    "Class\n",
    "Address\n",
    "Dob\n",
    "Fathers name\n",
    "Mothers’ names and so on. \n",
    "We may not require every information that we have collected to fill out the application. So, we select the data that is required to fill out the application. Hence, we have fetched, removed, and selected the data, the student information from large data. This process is known as abstraction in the oops concept\n",

    "Inheritance is a method in which one object acquires/inherits another object’s properties, and inheritance also supports hierarchical classification. The idea behind this is that we can create new classes built on existing classes, i.e., when you inherit from an existing class, we can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Inheritance represents the parent-child relationship. To know more about this concept check the free inheritance in java course.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a whale is a part of the classification of marine animals, which is part of class mammal, which is under that class of animal. We use hierarchical classification, i.e., top-down classification. If we want to describe a more specific class of animals such as mammals, they would have more specific attributes such as teeth; cold-blooded, warm-blooded, etc. This comes under the subclass of animals whereas animals come under the superclass. The subclass is a class which inherits properties of the superclass. This is also called a derived class. A superclass is a base class or parental class from which a subclass inherits properties.\n",

    "We use inheritance mainly for method overriding and R:\n",

    "To inherit a class, we use the extend keyword. \n",

    "\n",
    "Single level  \n",

    "Polymorphism refers to many forms, or it is a process that performs a single action in different ways. It occurs when we have many classes related to each other by inheritance. Polymorphism is of two different types, i.e., compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. One of the examples of Compile time polymorphism is that when we overload a static method in java. Run time polymorphism also called a dynamic method dispatch is a method in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at run time rather than compile time. In this method, the overridden method is always called through the reference variable. By using method overloading and method overriding, we can perform polymorphism. Generally, the concept of polymorphism is often expressed as one interface, and multiple methods. This reduces complexity by allowing the same interface to be used as a general class of action. \n",
