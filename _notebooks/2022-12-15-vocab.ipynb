    "Creating a class in Java involves defining a new data type. In order to create a class, you use the class keyword followed by the name of the class. There are certain naming conventions that should be followed when choosing a name for a class. For example, the name of a class should start with a capital letter, and it should use camel case (e.g. \"MyClass\").\n",

    "A constructor is a special type of method that is used to create and initialize an object. A constructor is called when an object is created, and it has the same name as the class. Unlike other methods, a constructor does not have a return type, not even void. This is because a constructor is not a function that returns a value, but rather it is used to initialize the object.\n",

For example, if a class has a private field named name, it might have a getter method named getName() that returns the value of that field. This allows other classes to access the value of the private field without being able to modify it directly.\n",

For example, if a class has a private field named name, it might have a setter method named setName() that allows you to change the value of that field. This allows other classes to modify the value of the private field without being able to access it directly. Setter methods typically have a void return type, because they do not return a value.\n",
